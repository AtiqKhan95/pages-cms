# Active Context: Pages CMS

## Current Focus

The current focus for Pages CMS is understanding the existing codebase and its architecture. As this is the initial setup of the memory bank, we're documenting the system as it currently exists to establish a baseline for future work.

Key areas of focus include:
- Understanding the core architecture and components
- Documenting the GitHub integration mechanisms
- Mapping out the content management workflows
- Identifying the authentication and authorization systems
- Understanding the field system and its extensibility

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial documentation, there are no recent changes to report. This section will be updated as work progresses on the project.

## Active Decisions

### Documentation Strategy
- Creating comprehensive memory bank documentation to facilitate future work
- Organizing information in a structured way to make it accessible and maintainable
- Focusing on both technical details and user experience considerations

### Development Approach
- Exploring the codebase systematically to understand its structure and patterns
- Identifying key components and their relationships
- Documenting technical constraints and dependencies

## Current Challenges

### Understanding Complex Interactions
- The GitHub integration involves multiple components and API interactions
- The content configuration system has a complex schema with many options
- The field system is extensible and has many different field types

### Mapping User Flows
- Understanding how users interact with the system
- Identifying potential pain points or areas for improvement
- Documenting the complete user journey from authentication to content editing

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Initial Documentation**
   - Finish setting up the memory bank with all required files
   - Ensure documentation covers all major aspects of the system

2. **Explore Key Components in Detail**
   - Dive deeper into the GitHub integration
   - Examine the content editing workflow
   - Understand the media management system

3. **Identify Potential Improvements**
   - Look for opportunities to enhance user experience
   - Identify any technical debt or areas for refactoring
   - Consider potential new features or enhancements

4. **Develop Test Cases**
   - Create scenarios to validate understanding of the system
   - Test different content configurations and editing workflows

## Open Questions

1. How well does the system handle very large repositories?
2. What are the most common user pain points in the current implementation?
3. How extensible is the field system for custom field types?
4. What are the performance implications of different content structures?
5. How does the system handle concurrent edits by multiple users?

## Current Environment

- Development environment is being set up
- Initial exploration of the codebase is underway
- Documentation is being created to establish a baseline understanding

## Key Stakeholders

- Developers maintaining the Pages CMS codebase
- Content creators using the system
- Repository administrators setting up and configuring the CMS
- Collaborators working together on content
